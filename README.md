## What is Easy Rules?

Easy Rules is a Java rules engine inspired by an article called *"[Should I use a Rules Engine?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RulesEngine.html)"* of [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) in which Martin says:

> You can build a simple rules engine yourself. All you need is to create a bunch of objects with conditions and actions, store them in a collection, and run through them to evaluate the conditions and execute the actions.

This is exactly what Easy Rules does, it provides the `Rule` abstraction to create rules with conditions and actions, and the `RulesEngine` API that runs through a set of rules to evaluate conditions and execute actions.

## Core features

 * Lightweight library and easy to learn API
 * POJO based development with annotation programming model
 * Useful abstractions to define business rules and apply them easily with Java
 * The ability to create composite rules from primitive ones
 * The ability to define rules using an Expression Language (Like MVEL and SpEL)

## Example

### 1. First, define your rule..

#### Either in a declarative way using annotations:

```java
@Rule(name = "weather rule", description = "if it rains then take an umbrella" )
public class WeatherRule {

    @Condition
    public boolean itRains(@Fact("rain") boolean rain) {
        return rain;
    }
    
    @Action
    public void takeAnUmbrella() {
        System.out.println("It rains, take an umbrella!");
    }
}
```

#### Or in a programmatic way with a fluent API:

```java
Rule weatherRule = new RuleBuilder()
        .name("weather rule")
        .description("if it rains then take an umbrella")
        .when(facts -> facts.get("rain").equals(true))
        .then(facts -> System.out.println("It rains, take an umbrella!"))
        .build();
```

#### Or using an Expression Language:

```java
Rule weatherRule = new MVELRule()
        .name("weather rule")
        .description("if it rains then take an umbrella")
        .when("rain == true")
        .then("System.out.println(\"It rains, take an umbrella!\");");
```

#### Or using a rule descriptor:

Like in the following `weather-rule.yml` example file:

```yaml
name: "weather rule"
description: "if it rains then take an umbrella"
condition: "rain == true"
actions:
  - "System.out.println(\"It rains, take an umbrella!\");"
```

```java
MVELRuleFactory ruleFactory = new MVELRuleFactory(new YamlRuleDefinitionReader());
Rule weatherRule = ruleFactory.createRule(new FileReader("weather-rule.yml"));
```

### 2. Then, fire it!

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // define facts
        Facts facts = new Facts();
        facts.put("rain", true);

        // define rules
        Rule weatherRule = ...
        Rules rules = new Rules();
        rules.register(weatherRule);

        // fire rules on known facts
        RulesEngine rulesEngine = new DefaultRulesEngine();
        rulesEngine.fire(rules, facts);
    }
}
```
